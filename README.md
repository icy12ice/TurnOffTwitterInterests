# Turn Off Twitter Interests
I got sick and tired of the plethora of clickbait and spoilers appearing thanks to Twitters absolutely terrible "interests" pushing tweets to my feed.

Apparently even setting the delay to 5 seconds is too fast for twitter. lmao if you had to do this manually it'd require at least 20 minutes of your life.


How to use:

Sign into your twitter.
Go here: https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests
Open up your chrome dev tools (f12) and click on the "console" tab
Copy, paste, and run the code. Come back in 10 minutes and all your interests should be deselected.



Notes:

Delay was added because if you didn't have the api it was sending to post requests to started blocking your requests, but it looked like all your interests were deslected. Kind of didn't want to care about the possiblitity of tracking down phantom interests where the checkbox was unchecked but the particular interest was still enabled.
